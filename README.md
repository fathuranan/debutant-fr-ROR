# README

This website was developed as part of a course completion requirement organized by the Ministry of Communication and Informatics (KOMDIGI) in collaboration with Progate Indonesia in August 2022. Built using the Ruby on Rails framework, the project integrates essential web development components while leveraging the Ruby programming language. The site also demonstrates a basic database integration using PostgreSQL, including a functional user login system as part of the back-end implementation.

The purpose of this website is to serve as a learning platform for Indonesian users who are interested in studying the French language but may not know where to begin. With a beginner-friendly interface and structure, the website aims to make language learning more accessible, especially for self-learners. It reflects both technical skill in web development and a practical approach to addressing educational needs in a digital era.

Beyond serving as a functional project for certification, this website also highlights my ability to design educational tools with a user-centered approach. The project involved planning content flow, structuring information for clarity, and ensuring responsiveness across different devices.
